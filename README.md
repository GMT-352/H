## Project Title:
 Determination of the areas of container houses to be built in Hatay after the 6 February Earthquake.


## A case study (region of interest): 
 Mitigating effects of the 6 February earthquake. 


## Aim and objectives:
#### The aim  
* The aim of this project is to detect areas that are no longer dangerous in Hatay for the construction of container houses that improve the living conditions of earthquake victims.


#### The objectives 
* To combine satellite data and on-the-ground inspections, to pinpoint the regions impacted by the earthquake that struck Turkey on February 6.
* To evaluate the viability of probable locations for container housing districts using criteria like slope, soil type, accessibility, and closeness to necessary services.
* To evaluate the capacity of these areas to the number of earthquake victims that require housing.
* To Prioritize locations based on factors including population density, vulnerability, and housing need, and suggest the best locations for container house neighborhoods.


## Requirements:
- Complying to computer hardware and software requirements for the installation and operation of the QGIS software.
- Compiling data on the topography, construction stock, population density, transportation infrastructure, water resources, and other geographic features in the seismic zone.
- Gathering data on buildings that are vulnerable to earthquakes.
- Data analysis from structures that suffered minor damages, major damage, demolished, and collapsed.
